Engineering Science

At present we do not produce a reading list for students applying for Engineering Science but we encourage you to read any relevant materials which you find interesting. Here are some online resources you may like to use to test your knowledge:

Isaac Physics: this website contains lots of maths and physics problem solving questions.
British Physics Olympiad: this website contains lots of past papers and solutions of problem solving type questions.
Next time: this website contains some quite fun questions designed to make you think about physical concepts.
I want to study Engineering: this website is just as useful for all applicants not just those applying to engineering.
Brilliant.org: this website has some resources to test your mathematical and physics knowledge.

Fine Art

The following list is suggested as a starting point and is not exhaustive and nor does it mean that you must read these.

Barthes, Roland, Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography (Vintage)
Crow, Thomas, The Rise of the Sixties: American and European Art in the Era of Dissent (Everyman )
Stallabrass, Julian, Contemporary Art: A Very Short Introductions (Oxford University Press)
Smith, Terry, Contemporary Art: World Currents (Laurence King Publishing)
We strongly encourage all students to attend exhibitions and look at art works as much as possible. Public art galleries like Tate Modern, the Whitechapel, and the Serpentine in London, the Ikon in Birmingham, the Liverpool Tate, the Whitworth in Manchester, the Baltic in Gateshead, the Arnolfini in Bristol, and Tramway in Glasgow are all excellent places to see contemporary art and to find out more about it.

Other excellent resources include:
the UK-wide exhibition listings
the online edition of the US journal Artforum
the excellent repository of moving image and sound art, called UBU Web

## 太神
Founded in 1996, UbuWeb is a pirate shadow library consisting of hundreds of thousands of freely downloadable avant-garde artifacts. By the letter of the law, the site is questionable; we openly violate copyright norms and almost never ask for permission. Most everything on the site is pilfered, ripped, and swiped from other places, then reposted. We’ve never been sued—never even come close. UbuWeb functions on no money—we don’t take it, we don’t pay it, we don’t touch it; you’ll never find an advertisement, a logo, or a donation box. We’ve never applied for a grant or accepted a sponsorship; we remain happily unaffiliated, keeping us free and clean, allowing us to do what we want to do, the way we want to do it. Most important, UbuWeb has always been and will always be free and open to all: there are no memberships or passwords required. All labor is volunteered; our server space and bandwidth are donated by a likeminded group of intellectual custodians who believe in free access to knowledge. A gift economy of plentitude with a strong emphasis on global education, UbuWeb is visited daily by tens of thousands of people from every continent. We’re on numerous syllabuses, ranging from those for kindergarteners studying pattern poetry to those for postgraduates listening to hours of Jacques Lacan’s Séminaires. When the site goes down from time to time, as most sites do, we’re inundated by emails from panicked faculty wondering how they are going to teach their courses that week.

The site is filled with the detritus and ephemera of great artists better known for other things—the music of Jean Dubuffet, the poetry of Dan Graham, the hip-hop of Jean-Michel Basquiat, the punk rock of Martin Kippenberger, the films of John Lennon, the radio plays of Ulrike Meinhof, the symphonies of Hanne Darboven, the country music of Julian Schnabel—most of which were originally put out in tiny editions, were critically ignored, and quickly vanished. However, the web provides the perfect place to restage these works. With video, sound, and text remaining more faithful to the original experience than, say, painting or sculpture, Ubu proposes a different sort of revisionist art history based on the peripheries of artistic production rather than on the perceived, hyped, or market-based center.

## 牛津 音乐 书目

https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/field/field_document/List%20of%20Recommended%20Reading%20for%20Music.pdf

A List of Recommended Reading for Music
General Reading and Listening
To get you thinking about studying music at university, you might like to read the following
inexpensive paperbacks (which may be available in your local library):
• Nicholas Cook, Music: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 1998)
• J. P. E. Harper-Scott and Jim Samson, An Introduction to Music Studies (Cambridge
University Press, 2009)
• Tia DeNora, Music in Everyday Life (Cambridge University Press, 2000)
Please listen widely and inquisitively, and think critically about what you’re listening to. If it’s a piece
for which a score is available, do try to look at the score too.
Study of music at Oxford includes certain core components, as well as optional study in performance,
composition, and project research. The suggestions below relate to the core components of the first
year of the course.
Analysis
For a general idea about analysis, have a look at the chapter on Analysis in An Introduction to Music
Studies (details in ‘General Reading’ above) and/or flick through the following:
• New Grove Online article on Musical Analysis
• Charles Rosen, The Classical Style (London: Faber, 1971).
Techniques of Composition and Keyboard Skills
In the first year of the course students have tutorials in style composition and keyboard skills,
designed to help them realize specific styles of tonal counterpoint both at the keyboard and on
paper. For keyboard skills we recommend the following useful introductory guides:
• David Ledbetter, Continuo Playing According to Handel (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990)
• R.O. Morris and Howard Ferguson, Preparatory Exercises in Score-Reading (New York:
Oxford University Press, 1931; reprinted 1995).
For techniques of composition, we recommend the following:
• Anna Butterworth, Stylistic Harmony, 2nd edn. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994).
Special Topics
Readings for each year’s special topics is given in the Handbook students receive at the start of the
academic year; one title for each of this year’s topics are given below. We encourage students to feel
free to read and listen around as relevant.
These are the topics being studied in 2015-16.
Machaut’s Songs
Guillaume de Machaut (c.1300-1377) a vital starting point for understanding music in the later
Middle Ages: more pieces survive by him than by any other medieval composer. We’ll study his
personal interest in having them collected, copied, and ordered, with a focus on the love songs
that make up the bulk of his output.
Preliminary Reading: Leach, Elizabeth Eva. Guillaume de Machaut: Secretary, Poet, Musician.
Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2011; paperback 2014.
Schubert’s Last Decade—the Instrumental Music
With such works as the ‘Trout’ Quintet and ‘Death and the Maiden’ Quartet, Symphonies 8 and 9
(the ‘Unfinished’ and the ‘Great’ C major), and the last three piano sonatas (D 958–60), Schubert’s
final decade (1818–28) is rich territory for the study of a style that Robert Schumann described as
follows: ‘Only few works are as clearly stamped with their author’s imprint as his’.
Preliminary reading: Christopher H. Gibbs, The Life of Schubert (Cambridge, 2000).
Preliminary listening (if possible with scores): to any or all of the above works.
Richard Strauss and representations of women
In his operas and tone poems, German composer Richard Strauss often represented forceful
female characters - from Salome to his wife. He was also drawn to composing for the soprano
voice, as is evident from his dozens of songs. What can the ways in which Strauss wrote for and
about women tell us about his long and varied career? What do they reveal about the social and
aesthetic values of music histories?
Preliminary reading: Bryan Gilliam, The Life of Strauss (Cambridge, 1999).
Preliminary listening: Many of Strauss's works are long and complex and it would be very helpful
to familiarize yourself with some of them over the summer. Good starting points would be the
operas Salome, Der Rosenkavalier and Die Frau ohne Schatten, the tone poems Don Juan, Don
Quixote, and Sinfonia domestica, and the so-called Four Last Songs (Vier letzte Lieder).
Global Hip Hop
After tracing the complex diasporic flows that came together to produce hip-hop culture in 1970s
New York, we will examine how hip-hop spread worldwide, with specific attention given to hip-hop
scenes in Brazil, Cuba, France, Japan, South Africa and Tanzania.
Preliminary Reading: Sujatha Fernandes, Close to the Edge: In Search of the Global Hip Hop
Generation (Verso, 2011).

## 牛津 中国 书目

https://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/chinese-ba-hons?filter-946-courses-660676=5681

Reading

Rather than listing individual titles, we suggest looking for works of Chinese fiction, poetry, and philosophical works, many of which are available in paperback. For more general surveys on China’s culture and language consult:

The Cambridge Illustrated History of China, ed. Patricia Ebrey, 1996.
A Cultural Atlas of China, Mark Elvin and Caroline Blunsden, Oxford, 1983.

With a global reach of over 10 million monthly readers and featuring dedicated websites for hard sciences, technology, medical research and health news, the Science X network is one of the largest online communities for science-minded people. Science X publishes approximately 200 quality articles every day, offering some of the most comprehensive coverage of sci-tech developments world-wide.

Mission
The Science X staff mission statement is to provide thorough daily coverage of the full sweep of science, technology, and medicine news. Sci-tech readers will find coverage of relevant and interesting current events. We strive to bring our readers a large assortment of stories, catering to scientists, researchers, engineers, academia, tech geeks, students, and graduates alike. With a highly educated and sophisticated readership and target audience, Science X stories go beyond mere catchy jargon. We find out the who, the what, the where, the how, and the why of a story—and the why not. Our job is to find the interesting science and technology stories, uncover the details, and give our readers their daily dose of news at a single source.

History
Science X is wholly owned by Omicron Limited, headquartered in Douglas, Isle Of Man, United Kingdom. The website was founded in March 2004 by two PhD students motivated by the void in hard science news designed for informed and educated readers. The initial idea behind Science X was to cover physics, nanotechnology, and engineering news. While maintaining this focus, Science X has expanded its coverage to other relevant science and technology fields. Science X has thus filled the void and created a unique niche in science and technology daily news reporting. After its launch, the site immediately soared in popularity on the web. Today, Science X is an extensive sci-tech news portal for all major research disciplines.

Key Points
Science X offers the fastest news delivery to readers. We typically publish news 1-2 days before other news services.
All news stories are hand-processed and curated by qualified editors, obviating the problems of feed or bot aggregation. This ensures that high-quality, targeted sci-tech news stories are published on Science X.
The Science X editorial board operates in the public interest and is independent in relation to political, religious, economic, public and private special interests. Science X receives no funding from any third-party agency or organization, and is fully supported by advertising, which is distinctly marked. Science X is partially funded by reader voluntary donations in return for an ad-free experience.
Science X utilizes advanced programming technology to present news in clear and unambiguous classifications to create intuitive category and sub-category designations. Readers are able to identify news topics easily.
A personal Science X account opens up a host of useful features. Account holders can subscribe to our daily newsletter, track site activity, save favorite articles to bookmarks, set up their own homepage news filters, view new stories since their last visit, instant message other users, and more.
The unique 'Live-rank' feature was specifically developed by the Science X team to handle vast amounts of daily news. Live-rank combines artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that determine the popularity of a story among readers, editor ranking, time relevancy, and other factors. Live-rank shows the best up-to-the-minute stories because it combines two factors: Recency and reader appeal. In practice, AI Live-rank displays the most recent interesting stories in real time.
Editorial Process
Science X stories originate from diverse information sources:

Science X exclusive feature stories written by staff authors.
Editor-selected, licensed sci-tech news from all major news agencies.
Editor-selected news articles and press releases submitted by worldwide partnering universities and research and development centers.
Publications in highly ranked, peer-reviewed scientific journals.
At least two of our editors review every article independently to ensure nothing is overlooked. Editors check the format, the style and the content; fact-check the scientific content, ensure headline accuracy (to avoid clickbait, etc.), check the related reference publication, and actively proofread and edit the content to provide the best for our readers.

Reading Lists for English (2022-23)
In your first year at New College you’ll be working towards ‘Prelims’, taken in Trinity Term.
This consists of four papers. Paper 1, ‘Introduction to English Language and Literature,’ will
introduce you to the formal study of the English language and to some recurrent problems
in literary theory and history. What is literature and who decides? How important is the
figure of the ‘author’ in determining meaning? What makes literary language different from
other kinds of language? Much of the teaching for this paper happens through compulsory
faculty lectures and classes, and it is assessed by a portfolio of two essays submitted in
week 5 of Trinity term. You will also have additional tutorials and classes in college, spread
across the three terms. The other papers are Paper 2 (Old English), taught across
Michaelmas and Hilary terms; Paper 3 (1830-1910), taught in Michaelmas; and Paper 4
(1910-present) taught in Hilary. If you are studying English and Modern Languages, you will
study Papers 1 and 2 and one of Papers 3 and 4. The latter, Paper 4, is the recommended
option.
When term commences in October, you will be expected to have read everything on the
Core Reading List and some of the material on the General List, where you should follow
up your own enthusiasms and interests. Tutorials at Oxford operate on Nabokov’s principle
that ‘a good reader, a major reader, an active and creative reader is a re-reader.’ In termtime, then, we expect you to be rereading the basic primary texts alongside secondary
criticism and more specialised material relevant to the essay topics you choose. There isn’t
time during busy Oxford terms with essays to write, criticism to read, lectures to attend
(and any number of other things to do) to be desperately trying to get to the end of
Middlemarch!
There will be a short test on the Victorian core list in 0th week of Michaelmas, to check that
you’ve done the relevant reading.

### 牛津 new school 经济

Economics
The first year course is divided into two main parts: microeconomics and macroeconomics. A
good understanding of elementary mathematical methods is essential to an understanding of
modern economics, and algebra, simultaneous equations, basic calculus (differentiation) and
basic statistics regularly come up throughout the course.
For a general introduction to the sorts of issues that economists try to address, why they
matter and how they might be resolved, we would recommend:
 Core Econ Textbook: free online introduction to economics found at https://coreecon.org/the-economy/book/text/0-3-contents.html
 T Harford, The Undercover Economist
 A Banerjee and E Duflo, Poor Economics
 D Helm, The Economic Borders of the State
 A. Dixit and B. Nalebuff, Thinking Strategically
 R Thaler, Misbehaving
We strongly recommend that those without A Level maths or equivalent put some time in to
start moving their maths knowledge forward and to get used to doing maths again after what
may have been a two-year break. For those with A Level maths, we would still recommend
that they refresh their memory of mathematical methods before arriving in October.
Before term, all students should review the material in Chapters 1-4 of the Maths Workbook
(that can be found at https://abiadams.com/teaching/prelims-micro/). We would
recommend trying the exercises throughout the text to test your understanding. Particular
questions from the Worksheets at the end of Chapters 1-4 will be set later in the summer.
In addition to the further reading suggestions in the workbook, there are many introductory
books in this area and it is very much a matter of taste which you use. Our suggestions are:
 I. Jacques, Mathematics for Economics and Business
 G. Kennedy, Mathematics for Innumerate Economists
 G. Archibald and R. Lipsey, An Introduction to a Mathematical Treatment of Economics
The Maths Workbook references the Jacques book repeatedly. The Kennedy book is
recommended as an amusing and helpful introduction to calculus, and Archibald and Lipsey
is designed for people with a maths block

### 牛津 new school 政治

Politics Reading List for 2022 Entrants to History and Politics
Politics
The first-year course is divided into three parts: political theory; empirical political
analysis; and quantitative methods.
In Michaelmas Term, you will have tutorials in political theory.
You will study three historical texts: John Locke, The Second Treatise of Government, Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, The Social Contract, and John Stuart Mill, On Liberty. Please obtain your own copies and
read them before the beginning of Michaelmas Term. Note: it is helpful if everyone owns the
same versions of the text so that we can refer to passages in tutorials. The Hackett press versions
of these texts are very inexpensive, and you can find them easily online.
You will study empirical political analysis in Hilary and Trinity Terms. The goal is to
introduce you to both the methods used, and the findings proposed, in the broad study of ‘how
politics works’ in different countries and over time. Rather than taking individual countries as
discrete units for detailed, isolated study, the course is thematic and comparative from the start.
As an introduction, we recommend:
A. Lijphart, Patterns of democracy: Government forms and performance in 36 countries, 2012.
Also, look through
W.R. Clark, M. Golder, and S. Golder, Principles of comparative government, 2009.
You will also have lectures and workshops in quantitative methods for political analysis,
organised in the university Department of Politics and International Relations. As an
introduction, you should try to look through
P.M. Kellstedt & G.D. Whitten, The fundamentals of political science research, 2008.

### 牛津 new school 法律

Prior to your arrival, you may wish to do some preparatory reading. The short book The Law, by
Jeremy Waldron (Routledge, 1990) would be a good place to start. You will find Chapter 6,
which contains an interesting discussion of the role of the judges in applying and developing the
law, particularly helpful. (NB: if you can’t access the book in your local library because of the
Covid situation, no worries – this reading is optional. There may be some cheap used copies of
this book available online – currently there are a few on Amazon for around £10-15.)
Oxford law students participate in a Legal Research and Mooting Skills programme, organised
by the Law Faculty. The webpage for this course ( https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/legal-research-andmooting-skills-programme ) contains some useful information which you may enjoy reading in
advance – see in particular the sections on Law Reports and on Legislation in the Overview page
(https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/legal-research-and-mooting-skills-programme/overview-legalresearch-materials).
Your criminal law tutor for the coming year, Marthe Goudsmit, has set up some preparatory
reading for you – you will find those elsewhere in this folder.
The best law students are aware of what is going on in the world. Regularly reading a quality
newspaper – eg The Guardian, for us in the UK – will heighten your awareness of contemporary
legal issues and the surrounding social and political debates, and is thus highly recommend

### 牛津 new school 政治 哲学 PPE

Reading List for 2022 Entrants to PPE
The first year’s work in PPE does not presuppose prior knowledge or experience with the academic
study of philosophy, politics or economics. In particular, having done A Level or the equivalent in the
subjects is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage. However, the pace of work is fast, and we expect
you to have oriented yourself to the subjects before you arrive, by doing some systematic reading from
the lists here.
It will also help you if you begin to think about current affairs in a serious way. We recommend that you
explore a range of media sources. News outlets like The Economist, Al Jazeera and The New York
Times offer both news coverage and analysis from a variety of perspectives. Similarly, The Financial
Times is one of the best papers for news. Other sources that focus on more in-depth analysis include
The London Review of Books, which is a mix of politics and culture, New Left Review, Foreign Affairs
and Le Monde Diplomatique (English edition). For a look into the expanding world of data journalism,
the website https://fivethirtyeight.com publishes articles using statistical analysis to report on
contemporary politics and economic news.
Philosophy
You will be working in three areas of philosophy during the first year:
• logic,
• ethics, and
• what we call 'knowledge and reality', that is, questions about the nature of reality and how we can
claim to know anything about it.
For logic, which you'll study in your first term, we will use
Volker Halbach, The Logic Manual, Oxford University Press, 2010.
It is not required but it may be useful to have read the first three chapters of the Logic Manual before
you get here.
The set text for ethics is: John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism, which you should certainly try to read.
For a good general introduction to the topics in philosophy we shall discuss in your first year, you
might look at:
Thomas Nagel, What Does It All Mean?
John Mackie, Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong
If you would like guidance on the more practical aspects of working productively as a philosophy
student, you could look at
Saunders, Mossley, MacDonald Ross, Lamb and Closs, Doing Philosophy: A Practical
Guide for Students (2nd edition, 2013).

Politics
The first-year course is divided into three parts: political theory; empirical political analysis;
and quantitative methods.

### 牛津 new school 物理

Maths Textbooks
The recommended maths text for the course is Mathematical Methods for
Physics and Engineering by K. F. Riley, M. P. Hobson and S. J. Bence (3rd
edition, Cambridge University Press). This is a very large book, but will
cover all the maths you need for the compulsory parts of the physics course.
You are advised, if possible, to obtain a copy before coming up to Oxford.
You may initially find this text very tough. A useful transition text is
Further Mathematics for the Physical Sciences by Tinker and Lambourne,
which is divided into a number of modules with self assessment tests so that
you can work out which chapters you need to read.
Introductory Problems
We will assume that you are familiar with Chapter 1 of Riley, Hobson and
Bence on arrival. This chapter covers the solution of polynomials, trigonometric identities, coordinate geometry, partial fractions, the binomial expansion, and methods of proof. The problems listed below are adapted from the
end of this chapter. You may find these problems quite tricky at first, but
with thought they should be possible. If you find them easy then look at
some other problems in Chapter 1.

Introduction

If you are offered a place to read Chinese Studies at Cambridge, the short period between leaving secondary school and coming into residence offers a valuable –and necessary – window of opportunity to do some effective preparatory work.

This reading list is also useful for preparatory reading for those applying to the Chinese Studies Tripos. Your admissions interviewers will be suitably impressed by the fact that you have done some useful reading prior to the interview.

Chinese language
Information about the Chinese language for you to review before coming up to Cambridge for the start of the Michaelmas Term.

Approaches to Music

Our 1684 Professor, Katharine Ellis, provides an introduction to Musicology – and why 'Music is good to think with' – in this British Academy blog post. To get a sense of the range of different approaches to music currently available, you might also try reading Nicholas Cook, Music: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2000) or The Cultural Study of Music: A Critical Introduction, edited by Martin Clayton, Trevor Herbert, and Richard Middleton (2nd edition, London: Routledge, 2012).

Analysis

Nicholas Cook, A Guide to Musical Analysis (Oxford, 1994) will introduce you to some of the ways in which one can think about musical structure and form.

Music History

You should begin to acquire an outline of the chronology of western music – the major composers, genres, developments – from the beginnings of plainchant up to the present day.  Browsing a single-volume textbook – e.g. J. Peter Burkholder, Donald Jay Grout and Claude V. Palisca, A History of Western Music (New York, multiple editions) – will provide a framework, which you should complement by listening to as many of the examples discussed as you can. It would also be good to explore at least one form of non-western or popular music: a useful beginning point would be Philip V. Bohlman, World Music: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2002).

Here are 500+ Ivy League courses you can take online right now for free
The 8 Ivy League schools are among the most prestigious colleges in the world. They include Brown, Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, Dartmouth, Yale, and Columbia universities, and the University of Pennsylvania.

All eight schools place in the top fifteen of the U.S. News and World Report national university rankings.

These Ivy League schools are also highly selective and extremely hard to get into. But the good news is that all these universities now offer free online courses across multiple online course platforms.

So far, they’ve created over 700+ courses, of which around 500 are still active. Combined, they received at-least 40 million enrollments

Class Central has made a collection of all these, which you can explore below. I’ve split these courses into the following categories:

Computer Science
Data Science
Programming
Humanities
Business
Art & Design
Science
Social Sciences
Health & Medicine
Engineering
Mathematics
Education & Teaching
and Personal Development
I’ve also assembled these courses on Class Central’s collection page for Ivy League online courses. This collection gets updated automatically as new courses are added. You can subscribe to receive updates by clicking the blue “follow” button there.

Note that some of the Coursera courses are a bit harder to access, so I wrote this guide to show you how. And if you are new to online learning, check out these 30 actionable tips to stay focused.

## 剑桥 古典

A good place to start (in translation or in the original) are Homer’s Iliad and/ or Odyssey, Virgil’s Aeneid, Euripides, Medea and Ovid, The Art of Love/ Ars Amatoria (at the moment the first set text on the Latin side).

In addition, try to get to know the different aspects of our field. There are a lot of resources freely available on the web (links below). Check out:

The Perseus Project: it features many Greek and Latin texts, both in translation and in the original, as well as other resources.
The podcast series ‘Ancient Greece Declassified’.
The YouTube channel Kings and Generals: while perhaps a bit narrowly focused on high politics, it offers a lot of material not just, or even primarily on Greece and Rome, but the ancient Mediterranean and Near East more generally.
If you have access to a library, try to sample some of the following for basic orientation (but they can also wait until you have arrived at Cambridge):

For ancient philosophy:
Julia Annas, Ancient Philosophy. A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2000).
For Greek history:
Robin Osborne, Greek History: the Basics (Routledge, 2013)
For insights into late-republican Rome and the Augustan period (our focus in Part IA):
Kathryn Tempest, Brutus: The Noble Conspirator (Yale University Press, 2017).
Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, Augustan Rome (Bloomsbury, 2018).
For Greek and Roman art:
Robin Osborne, Archaic and Classical Greek Art (Oxford University Press, 1998).
Mary Beard and John Henderson, Classical Art: From Greece to Rome (Oxford University Press, 2001)
For Linguistic:
P. H. Matthews, Linguistics: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2003). [This is a general introduction to the scientific study of language, not specifically focused on the ancient world – but it should give you a good idea what linguistics is all about.]

## 剑桥 艺术史

The most important preparation for History of Art at King's involves learning to train your visual memory and to develop your own critical skills. Visit as many museums and exhibitions as you can, taking descriptive notes of what you see. Visit buildings such as churches or country houses; you may find it helpful to record them photographically.

Start collecting postcards, which can be stored in a card-index box. Don't be afraid to sketch, even if you have no artistic talent. It is an excellent way of remembering images, and you will be amazed how quickly your drawings improve!

When a work of art or architecture excites you, try to analyse why it has this effect. The other essential preparation is to gain a firm grounding in iconography by improving your knowledge of the Bible and classical mythology. A good basic knowledge of European history is also extremely useful. The course does not require any specific prior knowledge of the History of Art, but you may like to read some of the following books before you start at Cambridge.

Surveys
E.H. Gombrich, The Story of Art (several editions)

H. Honour & J. Fleming, A World History of Art (several editions)

N. Pevsner, An Outline of European Architecture (several editions)

## 剑桥 音乐

Here are some general suggestions intended to ease the transition from school to University, followed by specific information relating to preparation for the first year.

Most first-year undergraduates reading Music at Cambridge find the course stimulating and challenging. Perhaps one of the most difficult hurdles you will face will be getting used to the idea of thinking about music; that is, you need to take very seriously the idea of music as a subject of intellectual enquiry, as well as being something you ‘do’ or ‘make’.

Among other things, this means becoming familiar with musical repertories other than those related to your principal instrument(s). Getting to know as much music as possible should be one of your primary concerns, both before and during (and after!) your time at Cambridge; none of us knows enough music. One of the easiest, most inexpensive ways to do this is by listening to the radio, or downloading a free music streaming programme such as Spotify.

Once here, you will be able to use the resources available in the College and Faculty libraries, but there is no substitute for building up your own personal library of books and study scores, so that you have them to hand as and when you need them. Music and music books are expensive, but bear in mind that they can be put to multiple uses: a Dover volume of Mozart or Haydn string quartets, for example, will help you with work in harmony and counterpoint, analysis, and history, as well as providing excellent material for score-reading practice.

Another vital skill for all your studies is the ability to ‘hear’ a score—including one that you are writing—in your head, without the intermediary of an instrument or recording. Conversely, you need to be able to ‘visualise’ to some extent the score of a piece to which you are listening. Most students find these skills difficult, and it is not easy to suggest fail-safe methods of acquiring them; nonetheless, they are probably key to your enjoyment of your studies at Cambridge, and you are encouraged to work at them.

If you cannot buy music and books locally, you can order them on the internet (e.g. from Amazon; for second-hand or out-of-print books and music, try Abebooks); or from Brian Jordan, 10 Green Street, Cambridge, CB2 3JU. Waterstones at 82 Gower Street, London WC1E 6EQ also has a good second-hand music books section. It’s always worth keeping an eye on your local Oxfam shop, where second-hand scores are to be found surprisingly often (Cambridge and Oxford have particularly good Oxfam Book Shops). Books and scores are also to be found on the regular Tuesday and Thursday stalls at the Cambridge Market.

You will probably have your own audio resources to bring with you to Cambridge. It's well worth making sure that you have access to good reception of BBC Radio 3 and Classic FM; this will prove both useful and enjoyable.

Preparation for first year courses
The following notes are essentially identical to those found in the ‘Preparatory Reading List’ issued by the Faculty of Music to incoming first-year undergraduates, though they also incorporate some additional material.

Analysis
A good general introduction to the subject is Nicholas Cook: A Guide to Musical Analysis (Oxford, 1994). During your first year you will be required to study in detail Book 1 of Bach's Das wohltemperirte Clavier (The well-tempered Clavier), ed. Richard Jones (ABRSM, 1994); you will need to purchase your own copy of this edition. Dover scores of string quartets and symphonies by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven are useful and fairly inexpensive. You should get to know several quartets and symphonies by all three composers. Follow the score as you listen, and concentrate carefully. Play through (it doesn’t matter how well or badly) piano sonatas by the same composers.

An excellent study of late eighteenth-century music, available in an inexpensive paperback edition, is William E. Caplin, Classical Form: A Theory of Formal Functions for the Instrumental Music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven (Oxford: OUP, 1998); this will be invaluable not only for your Analysis studies but also for your understanding of classical-period harmony. A useful primer is Edward Aldwell and Carl Schachter, Harmony and Voice Leading, 3rd edition (Wadsworth Publishing Co., 2002).

Harmony and Counterpoint
Before you come to Cambridge, please play and study the following:

The chorale harmonisations of J. S. Bach.
Recommended edition: Breitkopf and Härtel, ed. B. F. Richter; less good but adequate: Chappell, ed. Albert Riemenschneider

Schubert Lieder.
Recommended edition: Dover (either Schubert’s Songs to Texts by Goethe or Complete Song Cycles). The Lieder of Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Schumann are also recommended for your attention

Renaissance polyphony.
Listen to some of the many fine recordings of the music of Palestrina and his contemporaries (the Gimell and Hyperion labels are a rich source).

Many of the relevant scores are also available to download for free from the IMSLP website.

History
As a general introduction to the entire field, read Nicholas Cook, Music: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford: OUP, 2000). More specifically, you should familiarise yourself with at least one of Mozart's Da Ponte operas; with instrumental and vocal music of the nineteenth century; and with some music of the twentieth century. You will benefit from casting an eye over parts of Richard Taruskin, A History of Western Music (Oxford: OUP, 2004), both for its sections on opera, and for its extensive coverage of twentieth-century music. You can broaden your appreciation of historical and cultural approaches to music through reading Philip Bohlman: World Music: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford: OUP, 2002), and The Cultural Study of Music: A critical introduction, ed. Martin Clayton, Trevor Herbert, and Richard Middleton (2nd edition, London: Routledge, 2012).

At Cambridge, you will become familiar with reading articles in leading musicological journals; new research is continually being disseminated in this format. Many journals and other important research sources such as Grove's Dictionary are now available in electronic format, and you will have free online access to these once you are here.

Keyboard Skills
A piano technique roughly equivalent to Associated Board Grade VI will be helpful. Useful texts include Continuo playing according to Handel, ed. David Ledbetter (Clarendon Press, 1990), and R. O. Morris and Howard Ferguson: Preparatory Exercises in Score Reading (Oxford: OUP, 1931).

No knowledge of Philosophy is presupposed by the course at Cambridge. It is essential, however, to have done some advance reading, and this list is provided for guidance. The aim has been to list mainly works of original philosophy and to list only such works as can (with more or less effort) be understood by people new to the subject. Please do not be discouraged if you find the books difficult. You are welcome to write to us if you would like further guidance or recommendations about subjects not covered here.
