The Department of Computer Science at Oxford hosts Open Days and events for school-age pupils. These are normally free of charge and range from five-day residential courses to one off Taster Days. Please note that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all of outreach is currently remote in format.

Suggestions for Computer Science and Philosophy applicants

If you're interested in applying to study Computer Science and Philosophy and want to find out a bit more about Philosophy, some suggested reading materials are given here.

Candidates with offers

The following are suggestions for summer reading once you've been offered a place on an Oxford undergraduate Computer Science course (including joint honours courses). You do not necessarily need to purchase these - your local library can probably help, and there will be copies available in your College library once you get to Oxford.

A functional programming book:
    Programming in Haskell (2nd edition) by Graham Hutton; Cambridge University Press, 2016 OR
    Introduction to Functional Programming using Haskell (2nd edition) by Richard Bird; Prentice-Hall International, 1998 OR

Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! A Beginner's Guide by Miran Lipovača; No Starch Press, 2011.

The first is more accessible but the second covers more areas relevant to the Oxford Computer Science degrees. These books are intended to be challenging so please don't worry if you find them difficult. Richard Bird's book is the set text for the Functional Programming course that you will take in your first term: during this course you will have the benefit of tutorials, lectures and practicals to help your understanding, not just the text book in isolation.

A background text on discrete Maths, for example one of these (there are many others):

    Discrete Mathematics (5th edition) by Kenneth Ross and Charles Wright; Prentice-Hall, 2003.
    Discrete Mathematics by A Chetwynd and P Diggle; Arnold, 1995.
    Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics: An Applied Introduction (5th edition) by Ralph P Grimaldi (3rd edition); Addison Wesley, 2003.

A study skills guide:
    How to Study for a Mathematics Degree by Lara Alcock; Oxford University Press, 2012. (Maths focused, but much of the content is also applicable to mathematical Computer Science.)

Students without Further Maths

Although an A-level in Further Maths is not a requirement for studying Computer Science at Oxford, it is recommended. If you have only studied a single A-level in Maths, it would be helpful for you to do some preparatory work particularly focusing on discrete Maths and logical thinking, before coming up in October. Please see the free resources from the Oxford University Mathematical Institute

Other useful texts:
       How to Prove It: A Structured Approach by Daniel Velleman. ISBN: 978-0521446631
       Algorithmics: The Spirit of Computing by David Harel. ISBN: 978-0321117847 - the concepts, ideas, methods and results fundamental to Computer Science, in a way that is independent of the details of specific computers, languages, etc.

## Math transition

https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/how-apply/single-level

Single A-level Mathematicians

Each year a number of students with just a single A-level in mathematics apply to read Mathematics, Computer Science, or joint honours courses at Oxford. We encourage candidates for these courses to study whatever mathematics is available to them at school, but realise that many students do not have the opportunity to take Further Mathematics, or may have to teach themselves. If your school or college does not offer Further Mathematics, then you may wish to contact the Advanced Maths Support Programme to see if they can help you learn Further Maths.

Statistics show that single A-level mathematicians are just as successful studying at Oxford as others; however, the transition to university level maths can be somewhat harder. College tutors often ask such students to do extra reading over the summer before coming to Oxford, and the personalized nature of Oxford's tutorial system is especially suited to deal with the different educational backgrounds of new students.

The page Bridging the Gap contains material aimed at facilitating this transition. The original notes have now been expanded and revised into a book "Towards Higher Mathematics: A Companion" by Richard Earl, published by Cambridge University Press.

Several years ago, a series of classes was run for students with single A-level maths during their first term at Oxford, aimed at making the transition to university level mathematics easier. The handouts for some of these classes are below:

Vectors and Matrices
    Algebra of vectors and matrices. 2x2 matrices. Inverses. Determinants. Simultaneous linear equations. Standard transformations of the plane.

Techniques of Integration
    Integration by Parts. Substitution. Rational functions. Partial fractions. Trigonometric substitutions. Numerical methods.

Differential Equations
    Linear differential equations with constant coefficients. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations. Integrating Factors. Homogeneous polar equations.

Complex Numbers
    Cartesian and polar form of a complex number. The Argand diagram. Roots of unity. The relationship between exponential and trigonometric functions.

Induction and Recursion
    Using induction in sums and integrals. Further applications. Linear Difference Equations. Ties with Linear Algebra.

Taylor Series (no pdf available)
    Definitions. The Taylor series of standard functions. Convergence issues. Applications in differential equations. Generating Functions.

Abstract Algebra (no pdf available)
    The integers. Prime Numbers. Modular arithmetic. Definition of a group. Examples.

## CS Philosopy

http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/why_oxford/ReadingsOutlineHandout.pdf

Getting Into Oxford

With regard to admission, it’s first important to note that (a) you will not be judged at all on what you know about Philosophy (so you’re not expected to have read any “classic” works, for example); and (b) the most important factor for being offered a place to study CS&P is your ability in mathematical, computational, and logical problem-solving. So from the point of view of preparing for application, most of your effort should go into practising mathematics for the Mathematics Admissions Test (the MAT). Past papers and solutions are available online from www.cs.ox.ac.uk/mat, and other resources are listed on the “Background reading” page mentioned above. For example, you might want to try out the STEP support programme offered by Cambridge University, or look at the Test of Mathematics for University Admission (TMUA), while NRich Maths offers problem-solving resources, and Project Euler gets you started on mathematical programming.

Philosophy Choices at Oxford

Computer Science & Philosophy (CS&P) is an extremely flexible degree programme, offering a very wide choice of Philosophy courses, none of which is compulsory beyond the first year. So if you wish, you can focus on courses that are relatively technical (e.g. Philosophical Logic, Philosophy of Mathematics or Physics), or connected more with AI (e.g. Philosophy of Language, Mind, or Cognitive Science), or science more generally (e.g. Knowledge and Reality, Philosophy of Science and/or Social Science), or in “practical” Philosophy (e.g. Ethics, Practical Ethics, Theory of Politics), or more historical (e.g. Early Modern Philosophy, Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Post-Kantian Philosophy, Wittgenstein). Other popular modules currently available include Aesthetics, Philosophy of Religion, Feminist Philosophy, or a Thesis in any area of your choice.

Sampling First Year Philosophy

In the first year, the Philosophy side of CS&P involves three components, of which the largest is “Elements of Deductive Logic”. This is a rigorous course in formal logic, taken only by students in CS&P, Mathematics & Philosophy, and Physics & Philosophy. One of the other components, “Alan Turing on Computability and Intelligence”, is taken only in CS&P, introducing foundational theory of computation as well as issues in the philosophy of mind. The upshot is that first years in CS&P study more logic and theory of computation – both of which are central to Computer Science – than single honours CS students! The only component that would be out of place in a pure CS degree is “General Philosophy”, which introduces a range of central topics about knowledge and our place in the world, starting from the writings of some classic thinkers (Descartes, Locke, and Hume). To sample this, go to http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/general-philosophy-2018, where you can find recordings of Peter Millican’s 2018 General Philosophy lectures (and accompanying handouts).

Will I Enjoy Philosophy?

Perhaps the best way to work out whether you will enjoy studying Philosophy is to spend time thinking for yourself about philosophical problems in the company of books like those below. Law’s book is particularly good as an introduction, offering short (but substantial) chapters on 25 varied topics. Reading and thinking through one of these each day would be a great way of discovering whether you will enjoy Philosophy:

 Stephen Law The Philosophy Gym (Headline, 2004)
 Simon Blackburn Think (Oxford, 2001)
 Nigel Warburton Philosophy: The Basics (Routledge, 1992)
 Thomas Nagel What Does It All Mean? (Oxford, 1987)
 Edward Craig Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2002)

If you like the idea of a book that contains 100 short philosophical puzzles to dip into, then you could try:
 Julian Baggini The Pig That Wants to be Eaten (Granta, 2005)
 Peter Cave The Big Think Book (Oneworld, 2015)

But if, on the other hand, you want to go more deeply into some problems of metaphysics:
 Earl Conee & Theodore Sider Riddles of Existence (Oxford, 2005)

For a more historical perspective, here are two classics from the British Empiricist tradition:
 David Hume Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748), edited by Peter Millican, Oxford World’s Classics, 2007
 Bertrand Russell The Problems of Philosophy (Oxford, 1912)

Hume’s Enquiry features in the General Philosophy course, with very interesting things to say on knowledge, scepticism, free will, and God. Millican’s introduction sets Hume in historical context, so you can learn a lot about the early modern period when so many classic problems were framed. But if you try this, bear in mind that it can take a bit of practice to get used to 18th century English, even with a writer as elegant as Hume. Russell is also an elegant writer, and his book has introduced many people to Philosophy over the years.

Finally Ethics is a major part of Philosophy, and increasingly seen as crucially important in the area of Artificial Intelligence and its applications (as discussed in the Futuremakers podcast referenced below):
 Simon Blackburn Ethics: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2001)
 David Edmonds Would You Kill the Fat Man? (Princeton, 2015)
 Peter Singer Ethics (Oxford Readers, 1994)

Blackburn gives an excellent overview, Edmonds introduces the subject through discussion of the notorious
“Trolley Problem”, while Singer provides a wide range of readings from Plato to the modern world.

Reading on Alan Turing and AI
Alan Turing’s fascinating work – which invented the subject of Computer Science and raised key questions about AI – features prominently in the first year of the CS&P course. If you’re keen to read up on this, try:
 Andrew Hodges Turing: A Natural Philosopher (Phoenix, 1997)
 Alan Turing and Charles Petzold The Annotated Turing (John Wiley, 2008)
 Jack Copeland Artificial Intelligence: A Philosophical Introduction (Blackwell, 1993)
 Michael Wooldridge The Road to Conscious Machines (Penguin, 2020)

Hodges’ book is short but informative. Petzold’s book is very difficult in places, but it’s worth trying the early chapters – we use this book in the first year course. Copeland and Wooldridge (who is Head of our Computer Science Department) give accessible and well-balanced introductions to the Philosophy and the History of AI.

Philosophical Podcasts

There are quite a number of excellent podcasts on Philosophy, several coming from authors listed earlier:

Philosophy Bites: from Nigel Warburton & David Edmonds, features an extensive series of discussions with leading philosophers, covering a huge range of topics
In Our Time: Melvyn Bragg’s classic BBC Radio 4 series, has many episodes on philosophical themes
Philosophy 24/7: David Edmonds interviews leading philosophers about highly relevant moral issues
The Public Philosopher: Michael Sandel (Princeton) discusses contemporary moral problems
Philosophy: The Classics: Nigel Warburton reads from his book which introduces 27 key historical texts
Philosophy and Science of Human Nature: Tamar Gendler (Yale) relates classic philosophical writings to contemporary work in cognitive science
Hi Phi Nation: Barry Lam finds philosophical ideas, tensions and unquestioned assumptions in news stories

Finally, of particular interest to CS&P, is the first series of the Futuremakers podcast, devoted to issues in AI Ethics (see https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/Article/2018-10-22-the-futuremakers-podcast for details), and involving discussions between AI researchers, social scientists and philosophers from Oxford – people you may meet and learn from if you come to study Computer Science & Philosophy here!

## 剑桥 python-challenges
https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/admissions/python-challenges-page

Python Challenges page
Can computers be used to create art? How fast can a computer read all of Wikipedia? How long would it take to walk every street in Oxford?

Work out the answers to these questions and more with our series of Explore beyond School mini-projects based on Python, a programming language. At the start of each month we will release a new challenge for aspiring scientists, which you can work on using Python.

These challenges are designed to stretch Year 12 students keen on studying STEM subjects at university. This can be your first taste of Python and you will need to install Python 3 on your computer (available online for free).  When exploring these problems using Python, you will need to use libraries of code compiled by other programmers; Python libraries are called ‘packages’. Solutions are available once you have completed the challenge, but try to get as far as you can on your own before checking the solutions page. See more details below, and on each challenge page.

You will be able to find each challenge when it’s released on this page.

The first challenge 'Can computers be used to create art?' is available here.

The second challenge 'How do computers recognise songs?' is available here.

The third challenge 'How fast can a computer read all of Wikipedia?' is available here.

The fourth challenge 'How long would it take to walk every street in Oxford?' is available here.

The fifth challenge 'How do computers modify images?' is available here.
