## STEP math test

This free online STEP Support Programme is offered by the University of Cambridge to help university applicants develop their advanced mathematical problem-solving skills and prepare for STEP mathematics exams.

What is STEP?
STEP is an additional mathematics examination, taken at the end of Year 13, which forms part of conditional offers to applicants for mathematics and some related degrees at Cambridge and some other universities.

STEP is designed to test candidates on questions that are similar in style to undergraduate mathematics. Although demanding, preparing for STEP gives you a chance to engage with interesting, challenging mathematics, to stretch yourself and to develop the mathematical reasoning, independence and confidence needed in an undergraduate mathematics degree.

STEP Support Programme - free online resources
The STEP Support programme is designed to help university applicants develop their advanced problem-solving skills and prepare for sitting STEP Mathematics examinations. The programme is developed by the Faculty of Mathematics and NRICH. It consists of online modules for individual additional study, along with hints and full solutions.

The resources are free and open to everyone.

The Foundation modules provide a structured introduction to solving STEP problems. The modules also introduce mathematical ideas beyond the A-level syllabus and include supportive self evaluation materials. They are designed to be studied weekly over about 6 months. If you are planning to take STEP 2 and 3 at the end of Year 13, we recommend you start studying the Foundation modules in Year 12. They are also useful for Year 13 students who want to study Mathematics at university but who are not planning to sit STEP papers.

The STEP 2 and STEP 3 modules assume that you have already worked through the foundation modules. We recommend that you start these in Year 13 (ideally you would start working on the STEP 2 modules soon after the beginning of Year 13, and the STEP 3 modules around January of Year 13).

If you have any questions about the assignments, or STEP in general, or feedback about our resources you can email us at step@maths.org, or contact us via twitter @stepsupportcam.

Please see here for more detailed advice on how to use the STEP Support Programme.

What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

Who are the problems aimed at?
The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge.

Currently we have 1038604 registered members who have solved at least one problem, representing 220 locations throughout the world, and collectively using 108 different programming languages to solve the problems.

Can anyone solve the problems?
The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So the determined participant will slowly but surely work his/her way through every problem.

Recommended Philosophy Reading

Prior study of philosophy is in no way a prerequisite for this degree. It is clearly sensible, though, to find out more about the subject first. Here are some recommendations for philosophy and logic reading, to complement the earlier list of mathematical texts. Selected reading from one or more, or similar texts, will help you get a flavour of the degree.

Simon Blackburn, Think
One or more of the shorter dialogues of Plato such as Protagoras, Meno or Phaedo. (Each widely available in English translation.)
Bertrand Russell, The Problems of Philosophy
Bertrand Russell, Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy
Joel David Hamkins, Lectures on the Philosophy of Mathematics

Recommended Mathematics Reading

A selection of mathematical texts is given below; some are technical books aimed at bridging the gap between A-level and university mathematics, which will help you fill in those gaps over the summer; others aim to popularize mathematical ideas, the history of a topic or theorem, or are biographies of great mathematicians, which may give you a flavour for how mathematics is discovered and the variety of topics studied at university. Of course, you aren’t expected to buy or read all, or any, of them, and the list is far from comprehensive.

Problems to Try
Dates
Consider dates written in the format DD/MM/YYYY e.g. 23/05/1967 or 07/02/1984. That first date has no repetition of digits, but the second date has repetition of digits; it has two zeros.

Show that every date between 2000 and 2099 has repetition of digits.
What was the last date before today with no repetition of digits?
When will the next such date be?
How many such dates were there in years from 1900 to 1999?
Alpha Algebra
The real number α satisfies α3+α2=1 (you are not expected to solve this for α).

Show that α4=−1+α+α2 and find a similar quadratic expression for α5.
Find a quadratic expression in α that’s equal to α−1.
Find a quadratic expression in α that’s equal to (1−α)−1.
Find a quadratic expression in α that’s equal to (1+α)−1.
Digit Sums
The digit sum of a non-negative integer is the sum of its digits e.g. the digit sum of 1089 is 1+0+8+9=18.

How many positive integers less than 100 have digit sum equal to 8?
For each positive integer n<10, how many positive integers less than 1000 have digit sum equal to n?
How many positive integers between 500 and 999 have digit sum equal to 8?
How many positive integers less than 1000 have digit sum equal to 8, and have one digit that’s at least five?
Lockers
A school has 1000 lockers and 1000 students. The lockers are arranged in a long corridor and labelled from 1 to 1000. Initially all the lockers are closed and unlocked. A student walks along the corridor and opens every locker. Then a second student walks along the corridor and closes every second locker (i.e. numbers 2, 4, 6, …). A third student walks along the corridor and changes the state of every third locker, closing it if it was open and opening it if it was closed. How many lockers are open now?

All the remaining 997 students now walk past one by one, and the kth student changes the state of each locker that’s a multiple of k.

After all 1000 students have walked past, what is the state of locker 100?

After just 100 students had walked past, what was the state of locker 1000?

Preparatory reading in Philosophy
For Philosophy it would be helpful if you could read the following books before term begins
in October.
THOMAS NAGEL: What does it all Mean?
In your first term you will study logic. The set text is:
VOLKER HALBACH: The Logic Manual, Oxford University Press, 2010.
Without further help you may find this text difficult, but we recommend that you read at least
the first four chapters of The Logic Manual before you get here.
If you would like guidance on the more practical aspects of working productively as a
philosophy student, you could look at Saunders, Mossley, MacDonald Ross, Lamb and

MATHEMATICAL
READING LIST
This list of interesting mathematics books and internet sites is mainly intended for sixth-formers planning
to take a degree in mathematics. However, everyone who likes mathematics should take a look: some of
the items are very suitable for less experienced readers and even the most hardened mathematician will
probably find something new here.
September 18, 2022

INTRODUCTION
The range of mathematics books now available is enormous. This list just contains a few suggestions
which you should find helpful if you wish to choose some mathematical reading. Do not feel you should
read all or most of these books: there is far too much here for even the most dedicated reader! Just pick
what appeals to you. Any reading you do will certainly prove useful, and it is also perfectly alright not
to have read any of the books in this list!
The books here are divided into three groups: historical and general (which aim to give a broad idea of
the scope and development of the subject); recreational, from problem books (which aim to keep your
brain working) to technical books (which give you insight into a specific area of mathematics and include
mathematical discussion); and textbooks (which cover a topic in advanced mathematics of the kind that
you will encounter in your first year at university). Do not feel that you should only read the difficult
ones: medicine is only good for you if it is hard to take, but this is not true for mathematics books. t
All the books on the list should be obtainable from your local library, though you may have to order
them. Most are available (relatively) cheaply in paperback or as kindle editions and so would make good
additions to your Christmas list. Some may be out of print, but still obtainable from libraries.
You might also like to look on the web for mathematics sites. Good starting points are:
NRICH (http://nrich.maths.org.uk)
which is a web-based interactive mathematics club; in addition there is:
Plus (http://plus.maths.org.uk),
which is a web-based mathematics journal. Both these sites are based in Cambridge.

1 DOING MATHEMATICS
How to Solve It George Polya (Penguin, 1990)
An old gem. First published in 1945, this book is an invaluable and timeless guide to mathematical
problem-solving. The Fields medallist Terry Tao describes it as the book from which he himeslf learnt.
This is the paperback edition, with an interesting and entertaining foreword by Ian Stewart. The Kindle
edition (2014) has a foreword by John H. Conway. Highly recommended.

How to study for a maths degree Lara Alcock (OUP, 2013)
This sounds like the sort of book that could be terrible, but it turns out to be rather good. What is
written on the cover tells you accurately what is inside, so there is no need to say any more. Definitely
worth a look.

How to Think like a Mathematician Kevin Houston (CUP, 2009)
There is lots of good mathematics in this book (including many interesting exercises) as well as lots
of good advice. How can you resist a book the first words of which (relating to the need for accurate
expression) are:

Question: How many months have 28 days?
Mathematician’s answer: All of them.

2 HISTORICAL AND GENERAL
One of the most frequent complaints of mathematics undergraduates is that they did not realise until
too late what was behind all the material they wrote down in lectures: Why was it important? What
were the problems which demanded this new approach? Who did it? There is much to be learnt from a
historical approach, even if it is fairly non-mathematical.
Mathematics: Queen and Servant of Science E.T. Bell (Spectrum, 1996)
Another old gem. An absorbing account of pure and applied mathematics from the geometry of Euclid
to that of Riemann, and its application in Einstein’s theory of relativity. The twenty chapters cover
such topics as: algebraroups, ge, number theory, logic, probability, infinite sets and the foundations
of mathematics, rings, matrices, transformations, gometry, and topology. As Martin Gardner says in
the foreword: “This continues to be one of the finest of all introductions to the rich diversity of those
fantastic structures that mathematicians invent, explore, and apply with such mysterious success to the
huge unfathomable world outside the little organic computers at the top of their heads”.
1
Mathematicians: An Outer View of the Inner World Mariana Cook (Princeton
University Press, 2009)
Another, more modern, biographical approach. This book gives a compelling and immediate introduction
to some of the most amazing mathematicians of our time, not just through a glimpse of their brilliant
mathematical work, but also of their experience as fathers, daughters, husbands, wives... Each portrait
is personal and in the voice of the mathematicians themselves. You will find out what inspired them to
pursue maths, and no doubt be inspired yourself to participate in the joy of mathematical discovery.
A Russian Childhood S. Kovalevskaya (trans. B. Stillman) (Springer, 1978)
Sonya Kovalevskaya was the first woman in modern times to hold a lectureship at a European university:
in 1889 she was appointed a professor at the University of Stockholm, in spite of the fact that she was
a woman (with an unconventional private life), a foreigner, a socialist and a practitioner of the new
Weierstrassian theory of analysis. Her memories of childhood are non-mathematical but fascinating. She
discovered in her nursery the theory of infinitesimals: times being hard, the walls had been papered with
pages of mathematical notes.
Alan Turing, the Enigma A. Hodges (Vintage, 2014)
A great biography of Alan Turing, a pioneer of modern computing. The title has a double meaning: the
man was an enigma himself, and the German code that he was instrumental in cracking was generated
by the Enigma machine. The book is largely non-mathematical, but there are no holds barred when it
comes to describing his major achievement, now called a Turing machine, with which he demonstrated
that a famous conjecture by Hilbert is false.
In Code: A Mathematical Journey Sarah Flannery and David Flannery (Workman
Publishing, 2001)
This is the story of Sarah Flannery, who at age 16 won the titles of 1999 Irish Young Scientist of the
Year and European Young Scientist of the Year for her innovative work on cryptography. An inspiring
read just for letting onself be carried along by the enthusiasm of mathematical discovery and exploration,
narrated by an adolescent with freshness and honesty, without hiding setbacks or frustration on the way.
Plenty of actual maths too: enjoy the accessible explanation of RSA Public Key cryptography, and the
many mathematical puzzles that intrigued Sarah during her mathematical journey (do have a crack at
them before looking at the solutions!).
The Man Who Knew Infinity R. Kanigel (Abacus, 1992)
The life of Ramanujan, the self-taught mathematical prodigy from a village near Madras. He sent Hardy
samples of his work from India, which included rediscoveries of theorems already well known in the West
and other results which completely baffled Hardy. Some of his estimates for the number of ways a large
integer can be expressed as the sum of integers are extraordinarily accurate, but seem to have been
plucked out of thin air.
A Mathematician’s Apology G.H. Hardy (CUP, 1992)
Hardy was one of the best mathematicians of the first part of this century. Always an achiever (his New
Year resolutions one year included proving the Riemann hypothesis, making 211 not out in the fourth
test at the Oval, finding an argument for the non-existence of God which would convince the general
public, and murdering Mussolini), he led the renaissance in mathematical analysis in England. Graham
Greene knew of no writing (except perhaps Henry James’s Introductory Essays) which conveys so clearly
and with such an absence of fuss the excitement of the creative artist. There is an introduction by C.P.
Snow.
2
The man who loved only numbers Paul Hoffman (Fourth Estate, 1999)
An excellent biography of Paul Erd¨os, one of the most prolific mathematicians of all time. Erd¨os wrote
over 1500 papers (about 10 times the normal number for a mathematician) and collaborated with 485
other mathematicians. He had no home; he just descended on colleagues with whom he wanted to work,
bringing with him all his belongings in a suitcase. Apart from details of Erd¨os’s life, there is plenty of
discussion of the kind of problems (mainly number theory) that he worked on.
Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman R.P. Feynman (Arrow Books, 1992)
Autobiographical anecdotes from one of the greatest theoretical physicists of the last century, which
became an immediate best-seller. You learn about physics, about life and (most puzzling of all) about
Feynman. Very amusing and entertaining.
Fermat’s Last Theorem Simon Singh (Fourth Estate, 2002)
This story of Andrew Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem is a firm favourite. Simon Singh does a great
job of explaining some of the very technical mathematics at the heart of Andrew Wile’s proof, including
along the way all sorts of mathematical ideas and anecdotes. Of course most mathematical research
is not as obsessive and shrouded in secrecy as this particular search, but the book reads almost as an
exciting thriller (with entertaining digressions) and conveys true passion for the beauty of mathematics.
You can watch the author talk about the mathematics involved in the book on Numberphile, at
https://youtu.be/qiNcEguuFSA
The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets Simon Singh (Bloomsbury, 2013)
”There is tons of maths hidden in the Simpsons”, as Simon Singh says. The sheer love of mathematics
by the producers of this popular series (mostly mathematicians) shines through. Great fun, if you’re a
fan of the Simpsons and Futurama. For this book too there is a companion video, at
https://youtu.be/bk_Kjpl2AaA
The Music of the Primes Marcus du Sautoy (Harper-Collins, 2003)
This is a wide-ranging historical survey of a large chunk of mathematics with the Riemann Hypothesis
acting as a thread tying everything together. The Riemann Hypothesis is one of the big unsolved
problems in mathematics – in fact, it is one of the Clay Institute million dollar problems – though unlike
Fermat’s last theorem it is unlikely ever to be the subject of pub conversation.
Du Sautoy’s book is insightful and attractively written. Some of the maths is tough but the history and
storytelling paint a convincing (and appealing) picture of the world of professional mathematics.
Finding Moonshine: a mathematician’s journey through symmetry Marcus Du
Sautoy (Fourth Estate, 2008)
This book has had exceptionally good reviews (even better than Du Sautoy’s Music of the Primes listed
above). The title is self-explanatory. The book starts with a romp through the history and winds up
with some very modern ideas. You even have the opportunity to discover a group for yourself and have
it named after you.
Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe Leon M. Lederman and Christopher T. Hill
(Prometheus, 2004)
The notion of symmetry is central to understanding the laws of physics governing the universe. This
book succeeds in making some of the most subtle and profound concepts of modern physics accessible to
a general audience, with minimal use of mathematical equations. It will take you, through the unifying
idea of symmetry, from classical mechanics and discussions of inertia in the solar system and Newton’s
laws, to Noether’s theorem and the connection between symmetry and conservation laws, to Einstein’s
relativity, the standard model and Higgs boson. The journey is peppered with original and entertaining
stories and analogies. Hugely recommended, though beware of the Kindle edition, which is apparently
full of misprints!
3
Closing the Gap: The Quest to Understand Prime Numbers Vicky Neale (OUP,
2017)
Some famous mathematical problems have the knack of being very easy to state, but very difficult to
solve. Fermat’s last theorem is an example. The twin prime conjecture, on which this book focuses, is
another. This conjecture states that there are infinitely many prime numbers whose difference is 2. As
you can guess by its name, a proof still hasn’t been found. Neale does a great job of taking the reader
through attempts at getting closer to proving the conjecture, explaining on the way the building blocks
of number theory and cutting edge mathematical ideas in a way that is both approachable and rigorous.
She conveys the excitement of mathematical research and collaboration, including the online ‘massive
collaborative’ Polymath project initiated just a few years ago by Tim Gowers, which led to new proofs
of related mathematical problems. The book also has plenty of problems to make you think, which is
always fun, and very good for you!
Euler’s Pioneering Equation Robin Wilson (OUP, 2018)
Euler’s equation,e
iπ + 1 = 0 connects five of the most important numbers in mathematics, and has been
voted the most beautiful mathematical theorem on several occasions. MRI scans have shown that this
elegant and deeply meaningful equation affect the brains of mathematicians in the same way as a work
of art! Robin Wilson explores each of the numbers in turns, through their historical mathematical development, then devotes the last chapter to the equation itself. You will learn many ways of approximating
π, anecdotes and ‘near misses’ by great past mathematicians, applications and proofs. A book for the
curious, and an enjoyable introduction to some fundamental mathematical ideas.

3 MATHEMATICAL ADVENTURES AND RECREATIONAL
You can find any number of puzzle books in the shops and some which are both instructive and entertaining are listed here. Other books in this section do not attempt to set the reader problems, but to
give an appetising introduction to important areas of, or recent advances in, mathematics.
http://www.cut-the-knot.org Alexander Bogomolny (since 1996)
This web site is absolutely brilliant. If you haven’t seen it before, you should take a look immediately.
It is like a mathematical labyrinth: you can wander through it for hours (years, probably), following
different links. It covers a huge range of mathematics, much of which is elementary (which is not the
same as saying it is easy) and all of which is interesting and beautifully presented — see, for example,
the 103 essentially different proofs of Pythagoras’s theorem.
http://www.dimensions-math.org Etienne Ghys (since 2006)
A mathematical film: a fascinating and very accessible journey though geometry and topology (where a
teacup and a doughnut have the same shape), touching on maps, tilings, transformations in space and
fractals, that takes you gradually to the fourth dimension. On the way you’ll pass through Flatland, encounter famous mathematicians and artists, and see abstract mathematical concepts in beautiful graphics
by mathematical artist and engineer Jos Leys. And, if you’re up to some more difficult mathematics,
check out the connections between knots and the Lorenz attractor, and even the Riemann hypothesis,
at www.josleys.com/articles/ams_article/Lorenz3.htm
The Colossal Book of Mathematics M. Gardner (Norton 2004)
Over 700 pages of Gardner for under 20 pounds is an astonishing bargain. You will be hooked by the
very first topic in the book if you haven’t seen it before (and probably even if you have): a diophantine
problem involving a monkey and some coconuts — can’t say more without writing a spoiler. At the
beginning, about 60 other books by Martin Gardner are listed, none of which will disappoint.
Problem Solving Through Recreational Mathematics Bonnie Averbach & Orin
Chein (Dover 2000)
One can never have enough maths puzzles! This is another great collection, from easier ones to some that
will leave you stumped, through quite enough variety to please all tastes, and to give an introduction
to all the main areas of mathematics while you have fun making your way through it. Lots of practice
problems, and hints and solutions to most puzzles.
4
Game, Set and Math. I. Stewart (Penguin, 1997)
Stewart is one of the best current writers of mathematics (recreational or otherwise). This collection
(which includes a calculation which shows why you need only be marginally the better player to win
a tennis match — whence the title) was originally written in French: some of the puns seem to have
suffered in translation, but the joie de vivre shines through. You might also like Stewart’s book on Chaos,
Does God Play Dice? (Penguin, 1990). Excellent writing again but, unlike the chaos books mentioned
below, no colour pictures. The title is a quotation from Einstein, who believed (probably incorrectly)
that the answer was no; he thought that theories of physics should be deterministic, unlike quantum
mechanics which is probabilistic.
To Infinity and Beyond Eli Maor (Princeton, 1991)
Not much hard mathematics here, but lots of interesting mathematical ideas (prime numbers, irrationals,
the continuum hypothesis, Olber’s paradox (why is the sky dark at night?) and the expanding universe
to name but a few), fascinating history and lavish illustrations. The same author has also written a
whole book about one number (e The Story of a Number), also published by Princeton (1994).
Cakes, Custard and Category Theory: Easy recipes for understanding complex maths Eugenia Cheng (Profile Books Ltd, 2015)
Entertaining, innovative, and packed with infectious enthusiasm and unexpectedly mathematical recipes.
The baking metaphors may seem a little forced at times, but on the whole work well.
A Mathematical Mosaic Ravi Vakil (Brendan Kelly, 2008)
This is a bit unusual. It’s is a brilliant collection of some of the most beautiful and intriguing mathematical ideas and problems, from Combinatorics to Game Theory, Geometry, Galois Theory and much
more, weaved into a mosaic that shows their connection. Ravi Vakil won several mathematical competitions and olympiads, and his perspective comes from his personal problem solving adventure. The
style is friendly and fun. The maths wonderful. The author starts by stating “Mathematics is an intensely social discipline” and proceeds to thank all those who have shared their love of mathematics with
him, especially “the young men and women who agreed to share their unique perspective on the joys of
mathematics for the seven profiles included in this book”.
Don’t be discouraged by the profiles of exceptional young mathematicians – they are exceptional!

4 READABLE MATHEMATICS
The MαTH βOOK Clifford A Pickover (Sterling, 2009)
The subtitle is ‘From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics’.
Each left hand page has a largely non-mathematical description of one of the great results in mathematics
and each right hand page has a relevant illustration. There is just enough mathematical detail to allow
you to understand the result and pursue it (if you fancy it), via google. The book is beautifully produced.
The illustration for the page on Russell and Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica, said here to be the
23rd most important non-fiction book of the 20th century, is the proposition occurring several hundred
pages into the book, that 1 + 1 = 2.
The Mathematical Experience P.J. Davis & R. Hersh (Penguin, 1990)
This gives a tremendous foretaste of the excitement of discovering mathematics. A classic.
Mathematics: a very short introduction Timothy Gowers (OUP, 2002)
Gowers is a Fields Medallist (the Fields medal is the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel prize), so it
is not at all surprising that what he writes is worth reading. What is surprising is the ease and charm of
his writing. He touches lightly many areas of mathematics, some that will be familiar (Pythagoras) and
some that may not be (manifolds) and has something illuminating to say about all of them. The book
is small and thin: it will fit in your pocket. You should get it.
5
Solving Mathematical Problems Terence Tao (OUP, 2006)
Tao is another Fields Medallist. He subtitles this little book ‘a personal perspective’ and there is probably
no one better qualified to give a personal perspective on problem solving: at 13, he was the youngest
ever (by some margin) gold medal winner in International Mathematical Olympiad. There are easy
problems (as well as hard problems) and good insights throughout. The problems are mainly geometric
and algebraic, including number theory (no calculus).
Archimedes’ Revenge P. Hoffman (Penguin, 1991)
This is not a difficult read, but it covers some very interesting topics: for example, why democracy is
mathematically unsound, Turing machines and travelling salesmen. Remarkably, there is no chapter on
chaos.
The Pleasures of Counting T.W. K¨orner (CUP, 1996)
A brilliant book. There is something here for anyone interested in mathematics and even the most
erudite professional mathematicians will learn something new. Some of the chapters involve very little
technical mathematics (the discussion of cholera outbreaks which begins the book, for example) while
others require the techniques of a first or second year undergraduate course. However, you can skip
through the technical bits and still have an idea what is going on. You will enjoy the account of Braess’s
paradox (a mathematical demonstration of the result, which we all know to be correct, that building
more roads can increase journey times), the explanation of why we should all be called Smith, and the
account of the Enigma code–breaking. These are just a few of the topics K¨orner explains with enviable
clarity and humour.
Calculus for the Ambitious T.W. K¨orner (CUP, 2014)
You can and should supplement your sixth-form calculus with K¨orner’s latest offering. You will find
here some familiar ideas seen from unfamiliar angles and almost certainly much that is unfamiliar;
multivariable calculus for example (when functions depend on more than one variable).
This excerpt from introduction gives you a flavour of the style: When leaving a party, Brahms is reported
to have said ‘If there is anyone here whom I have not offended tonight, I beg their pardon.’ If any logician,
historian of mathematics, numerical analyst, physicist, teacher of pedagogy or any other sort of expert
picks up this book to see how I have treated their subject, I can only repeat Brahms’ apology.
Logical Labyrinths Raymond S. Smullyan (CRC Press, 2008)
This book is a fun and engaging collection of logical puzzles, combined with a rigouous mathematical
introduction to logic. The carefully graded and entertaining progression leads you to the more formal
logical reasoning through a journey that is always challenging enough but manageable and rewarding.
Enjoy!
Luck, Logic, and White Lies: The Mathematics of Games J¨org Bewersdorff (A
K Peters Ltd, 2004)
Learn about (some of) the maths behind risk, uncertainty and gambling. Debunk some popular myths,
and improve your chances of winning at games! Very readable, clear and practical. A good introduction.
Insights into Game Theory: An Alternative Mathematical Experience Ein-Ya
Gura & Michael M. Maschler (CUP, 2008)
This book arose from Ein-Ya Gura’s PhD dissertation. It provides an introduction to the field of Game
Theory - the mathematical analysis of competitive strategies - for an audience without a background in
higher mathematics. Although the book avoids formal mathematical notation, rigorous proofs are given
of some of the major results of the field. And you can also use the many exercises provided to help
consolidate the material.
What is Mathematics? R. Courant & H. Robbins (OUP, 1996)
A new edition of a classic, revised by Ian Stewart. It has chapters on numbers (including ∞), logic,
duality, soap-films, etc. The subtitle (An elementary approach to ideas and methods) is rather optimistic:
challenging would be a more appropriate adjective, though interesting or instructive would do equally
well. Stewart has resisted the temptation to tamper: he has simply updated where appropriate — for
example, he discusses the solution to the four–colour problem and the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem.
6
Beyond Numeracy J. A. Paulos (Penguin, 1991)
Bite-sized essays on fractals, game-theory, countability, convergence and much more. It is a sequel to his
equally entertaining, but less technical, Numeracy.
Neural Networks and Deep Learning Michael Nielsen (Determination Press, 2015,
available in web-only format at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com.)
This a free online interactive book, that will teach you the core concepts behind what enables a computer
to learn from observational data. It uses a hands-on approach through many examples of code, whilst
retaining a focus on the mathematical aspect of the core principles. The style is accessible and compelling,
and the interactive elements throughout help develop intuition as well deepen understanding. This book
is a great starting point for anybody who is interested in this area of AI with applications in image
recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many areas of everyday life.
From Here to Infinity Ian Stewart (OUP, 1996)
This is a revised version of Problems in Mathematics (1987); revised of necessity, as the author says,
because some of the problems now have solutions — an indication of the speed at which the frontiers of
mathematics are receding. Topics discussed include solving the quintic, colouring, knots, infinitesimals,
computability and chaos. In the preface, it is guaranteed that the very least you will get from the book
is the understanding that mathematical research is not just a matter of inventing new numbers; what
you will in fact get is an idea of what real mathematics is.
What’s Happening in the Mathematical Sciences D. MacKenzie and B. Cipra
(AMS, biennial publication, since 1993)
This is a really excellent series, It contains low(ish)-level discussions, with lots of pictures and photographs, of some of the most important recent discoveries in mathematics. Volumes 1 and 2 cover
advances in map–colouring, computer proofs, knot theory, travelling salesmen, and much more. Volume
3 (1995–96) has, among other things, articles on Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, the investigation of twin primes which led to the discovery that the Pentium chip was flawed, codes depending on
large prime numbers and the Enormous Theorem in group theory (the theorem is small but the proof, in
condensed form, runs to 5000 pages). Volume 9 (2012–13) includes an article on the CERN experiment
that confirmed the Higgs Boson. The series is now up to Volume 12, which contains a three-part series
on the maths behind the battle to beat COVID-19. MAA members get a discount. Exciting stuff.
The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers D. Wells (Penguin,
1997)
A brilliant idea. The numbers are listed in order of magnitude with historical and mathematical information. Look up 1729 to see why it is ‘among the most famous of all numbers’. Look up 0.7404
(= π/√
18) to discover that this is the density of closely-packed identical spheres in what is believed by
many mathematicians (though it was at that time an unproven hypothesis) and is known by all physicists and greengrocers to be the optimal packing. Look up Graham’s number (the last one in the book),
which is inconceivably big: even written as a tower of powers (9 ↑ (9 ↑ (9 · · ·))) it would take up far
more ink than could be made from all the atoms in the universe. It is an upper bound for a quantity
in Ramsey theory whose actual value is believed to be about 6. A book for the bathroom to be dipped
into at leisure. You might also like Wells’s The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Geometry
(Penguin, 1991) which is another book for the bathroom. It is not just obscure theorems about triangles
and circles (though there are plenty of them); far-reaching results such as the hairy ball theorem (you
can’t brush the hair flat everywhere) and fixed point theorems are also discussed.
Curves for the Mathematically Curious: An Anthology of the Unpredictable,
Historical, Beautiful, and Romantic Julian Havil (Princeton University Press, 2019)
This book opens with a quote by Felix Klen (1958): “What is a curve? Everyone knows what a curve is,
until he has studied enough mathematics to become confused through the countless number of possible
exceptions.”, so prepare to be challenged! Meet some of the most famous and beautiful mathematical
curves, and through them explore many different fields of mathematics, from statistics to cryptography,
to analysis, to geometry, and much more. Lots of historical nuggets and fun facts too, besides the maths.
7
50 Visions of Mathematics Sam Parc (ed.) (OUP, 2014)
Written to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA),
this is a collection of 50 brief articles by different authors, introducing some of the many applications
of mathematics in a variety of areas, brief biographies of some of the look at maths in the same way
again. major mathematicians of the twentieth century, some fun maths, and some mathematical philosophy. All clear, engaging, sometimes humorous, with equations kept to a minimum (but further reading
suggested to follow up where you interest has been piqued), and brilliant pictures. You’ll find references
to everyday life (how GPS satellites work, medical imaging, and many more) as well as references to
fictional characters (for example, in ‘The Simpson’s rule’). There is an engaging and highly original
article about Pythagora’s theorem, cutting edge modern mathematics introduced in an accessible way,
the mathematical explanation of the annoying traffic jams that occur for no apparent reason, even ’proof
by pizza’. After reading this book, you may revise your idea of what applied mathematics is.
Reaching for Infinity S. Gibilisco (Tab/McGraw-Hill, 1990)
A short and comfortable, though mathematical, read about different sorts of infinity. It has theorems,
too, which are good for you. An example: ℵ0 + ℵ1 = ℵ1. This probably needs a bit of explanation.
Loosely speaking: ℵ0 (pronounced ‘aleph’ zero) is the number of integers (which is the same as the
number of rational numbers) and ℵ1 is the next biggest infinity. There is another infinity, c = 2ℵ0
, which
is the number of real numbers. The continuum hypothesis says that c = ℵ1, but it was not realised until
1963 that this cannot be proved or disproved.
The Computational Beauty of Nature: Computer Explorations of Fractals,
Chaos, Complex Systems, and Adaptation Gary W Flake (MIT Press, 2000)
This book covers a wide breadth of topics, including G¨odel’s Incompleteness theorem, Cellular Automata,
Genetic Algorithms, and Neural Networks, as well as – as expected – Chaos and Fractals. It doesn’t
require much mathematics at all to start with, but introduces advanced mathematical concepts from
scratch with clear explanations and helpful example, and conveys the fascinating links between these
and the natural world. You can have fun using the numerous examples of pseudo-code to write some
code and play around with each topic. A great introduction to many fascinating topics, and, especially,
to using computer experiments as a tool to explore mathematical ideas.
Chaos J. Gleick (Minerva/Random House, 1997)
Sometimes, at interview, candidates are asked whether they have read any good mathematics books
recently. There was a time when nine out of ten candidates who expressed a view named this one.
Surely they couldn’t all have been wrong? Still a very enjoyable introduction, with a focus on the
history of chaos theory.
Chaos and Fractals: An Elementary Introduction David P. Feldman (OUP, 2012)
An enjoyable and very clear introduction to chaos and fractals that requires at the start no mathematics
beyond basics algebra. This approach enables the author to take you gently from basics concepts to
advanced mathematical ideas such as statistical stability, fractal dimension, Lyapunov exponent and
chaotic flows in phase space. The many exercises help clarify and understand the wealth of mathematical
topics tackled. Even though this is essentially a textbook, it is not dry at all: the writing is like
a conversation, which peppers rigorous maths with illuminating opinions about the development of
theories, and nuggets of quirky information about the mathematicians behind them.
Algorithms Unlocked Thomas H. Cormen (MIT, 2013)
“What are algorithms and why should you care?” asks this book. Mathematicians (aspiring and confirmed) should particularly care, given the usefulness of computers in many areas of mathematics, and
also the overlap between what could be described as ‘algorithmic thinking’ and ‘mathematical thinking’.
Donal Knuth analysed exactly this overlap in an article in The American Mathematical Monthly. He
concluded that the overlap is pretty much complete, aside from two main concepts: “complexity”, i.e.
economy of operation (algorithmic only), and “dealing with infinity” (mathematical only). If you’re
interested in problem solving with computers, but also the basic principles behind cryptography, or the
fundamental ideas of data compression, this book is an engaging and readable introduction. It answers
many interesting questions, including: “What does it mean to produce a correct solution to a problem?”

5 READABLE THEORETICAL PHYSICS
A Short History of Nearly Everything Bill Bryson (Black Swan 2004)
This one is for those of you who are more polymath than pure math. The book describes the Universe
and everything in it.
The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac Graham Farmelo (Faber and
Faber 2009)
Paul Dirac was one of the great scientists of the 20th century. His work unifying quantum mechanics
and special relativity gave rise to the Dirac equation, often argued to be the most beautiful equation
in physics. The man was almost as strange as his theories. You can read about both in this engaging
biography. Special relativity, quantum mechanics, and the Dirac equation are covered in many courses
throughout the Cambridge undergraduate degree.
Black Hole Blues Janna Levin (Vintage 2016)
A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, two black holes collided. The collision was so violent it caused
a rupture in the spacetime continuum, emitting ripples that we call gravitational waves. These waves
travelled unimpeded through the universe for 1.4 billion years until, on September 14th 2015, we felt
them. We will teach you about Einstein’s theory of general relativity and gravitational waves in the
third year. In the meantime, this book is great place to start.
The Particle at the End of the Universe Sean Carroll (Oneworld Publications 2013)
Not a great deal has changed on the elementary particle scene since this absorbing survey was written: it
was just in time to report first sightings of the Z and W particles. It even reports, with (as it turned out)
well-founded scepticism on claims to have seen the top quark. The final chapter makes the all-important
link between particle physics (physics on the smallest scale) and cosmology (physics on the largest scale).
The energies required to study the latest batch of elementary particles are so great that the Big Bang is
the only feasible ‘laboratory’.
The New Quantum Universe T. Hey & P. Walters (CUP, 2003)
The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2013 closed one chapter of particle physics and opened the next.
This book recounts the story of quantum particles, from atoms to electrons and nuclei, to the wonders
of quarks and gluons and W-bosons and, ultimately, the Higgs. The underlying mathematics will be
covered in the fourth year of the maths course at Cambridge.
A Brief History of Time Stephen Hawking (Bantam Publishing 1988)
An oldie but a goodie. We couldn’t finish this list without including the classic book from Cambridge’s
most famous physicist of recent times. Want to know why black holes aren’t black? Or what imaginary
time means? Or what happened at the big bang? This book won’t really tell you. But it may pique
your interest enough to stay on to the fourth year of the maths course where we will teach all of these
things.

6 READABLE TEXTBOOKS
There is not much point in trying to cover a lot of material from the first year undergraduate mathematics
course you are just about to start, but there is a great deal of point in trying to familiarise yourself with
the sort of topics you are going to encounter. It is also a good plan to get used to working on your own;
reading mathematics text books is an art not much practised in schools. Many of the following have
exercises and answers and some have solutions.
Advanced Problems in Mathematics: Preparing for University S.T.C. Siklos
(OpenBook Publishers, 2016)
This is a combined and much improved version by Stephen Siklos of his two previous booklets on STEP
problems: Advanced Problems in Core Mathematics (2003) and Advanced Problems in Mathematics
(1996). It is recommended as preparation for any undergraduate mathematics course, even for students
who do not plan to take the Sixth Term Examination Paper (STEP- the examination normally used
as a basis for conditional offers to Cambridge). It contains a selection of STEP–like problems complete
9
with hints, discussion and full solutions. There is a lovely introduction with two fully worked examples.
The problems are different from most A-level questions, being much longer (‘multi-step’ is the current
terminology) and sometimes covering material from apparently unconnected areas of mathematics. They
are more like the sort of problems that you encounter in a university mathematics course, although they
are based on the syllabuses of school mathematics. Working through one or both of these booklets would
be an excellent way of getting your mathematics up to speed again after the summer break. The book
is free to download from
http://www.openbookpublishers.com
or can be bought as a paperback.
Towards Higher Mathematics: A Companion Richard Earl (Cambridge University
Press, 2017)
This is a nice book, with some very useful introductory advice, and a wealth of exercises for practice. Using the language of sixth form mathematics to introduce substantial extension material beyond the school
syllabus, it enables students to bridge the gap between school-level and university-level mathematics.
The wide choice of topics covered is ideal preparation for any undergraduate mathematics course. The
more than 1500 carefully graded exercises are accompanied by hints included in the text, and solutions
available online.
The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data David Spiegelhalter (Pelican Books,
2019)
This is a great introduction to Statistics, aimed at the general reader, but also with plenty of material
going deeper into important topics for the more mathematically-inclined. It covers all the topics you
would expect from an introductory course in Statistics, and takes you in graded steps from fairly basic
to really challenging concepts. There are no mathematical equations and formulae, aside from the
very useful and accessible technical glossary at the end. Important statistical concepts are explained
using real life scenarios and case studies, building on intuition with cogent logical reasoning and helpful
visualisations. You’ll learn to distinguish ‘good data’ from ‘bad data’, and spot and call out deliberatly
abused data. On the way, you’ll be intrigued by seeing how statistics can help identify the luckiest
survivor from the Titanic, whether the mass-murderer Harold Shipman could have been caught earlier,
or whether the body dug out in Leicester’s car park really was Richard III. Expect to be taken through
interesting stories, analysing the evidence in the way Sherlock Holmes would.
Mathematical Methods for Science Students G. Stephenson (Longman, 1973)
This starts with material you already know and advances cautiously in traditional directions. You may
not be bowled over with excitement but you will appreciate the careful explanations, the many examples
and exercises and the generally sympathetic approach. You may prefer an entirely problems-based
approach, in which case Worked examples in Mathematics for Scientists and Engineers (Longman, 1985)
by the same author is for you.
Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering K F Riley, M P Hobson &
S J Bence (Cambridge University Press 1998)
Most of A-level pure mathematics consists of what could be called ‘mathematical methods’ — i.e. techniques you can use in other areas (such as mechanics and statistics). The continuation of this material
forms a basic part of every university course (and would count as applied mathematics!). This book is
a strong recommendation for any such course.
A Concise Introduction to Pure Mathematics Martin Liebeck (Chapman& Hall/CRC
Mathematic, 2010)
This is really excellent. Liebeck provides a simple, nicely explained, appetizer to a wide variety of topics
(such as number systems, complex numbers, prime factorisation, number theory, infinities) that would
be found in any first year course. His approach is rigorous but he stops before the reader can get too
bogged down in detail. There are worked examples (e.g. ‘Between any two real numbers there is an
irrational’) and exercises, which have the same light touch as the text.

What is Mathematical Analysis? John Baylis (MacMillan, 1991)
This book (now out of print, but available from libraries) is part of a series which is supposed to bridge
the gap between school and university. It covers some serious analysis (the intermediate value theorem,
limits, differentiation and integration) in a most accessible style: it never gets hard, though you will need
to study carefully. The layout could be nicer, but do not be put off: you can discover here a function
which is continuous at every irrational number but discontinuous (it jumps) at every rational number.
Who would have thought that was possible?
Groups: A Path to Geometry R.P. Burn (CUP, 1987)
Permutations, groups, matrices, complex numbers and, above all (or rather, behind all), geometry.
Yet Another Introduction to Analysis V. Bryant (CUP, 1990)
Yes, another; but a very good one. And it has solutions to the many problems. Analysis is the study of
all those things you think you already know how to do (such as differentiation, integration), from first
principles. This book goes through functions, continuity, series and calculus at a brisk trot; essential
material for any mathematician.
A First Course in Mechanics Mary Lunn (OUP, 1991)
A bridge between the sort of mechanics you meet at A-level and the sort you are going to meet at
university; not just a bridge, but also a good bit of road on the far side.
Understanding Probability Henk Tijm (CUP, 2012)
This book will give you a very accessible introduction to probability through a wealth of fun examples
and exercises. The explanations are refreshingly clear and though-provoking, adding much even to
well-known classic problems. You won’t need much mathematics to read the first part, which provides
an intutive approach to probability. The second part is more technical. Fully discussed solutions are
provided at the end of the book for all odd-numbered problems.

The NRICH Project aims to enrich the mathematical experiences of all learners. To support this aim, members of the NRICH team work in a wide range of capacities, including providing professional development for teachers wishing to embed rich mathematical tasks into everyday classroom practice

Primary Curriculum

https://nrich.maths.org/12632

On this page, you will find four groups of resources which will help you embed problem solving into your curriculum:
Curriculum Mapping Documents
Features
Collections
Resources to develop Mathematical Habits of Mind.

Curriculum Mapping Documents

Our Curriculum Mapping Documents link NRICH tasks to curriculum objectives.
Primary Curriculum Mapping Documents
The documents on this page contain everything you need to include problem-solving activities in your planning, as they link up the National Curriculum statements with some of our favourite activities.

Features

Our features gather together tasks and articles around a theme.  They are very usefully explored during a staff meeting, for example.  Our features generally fall into one of the following four categories:
Aims of the National Curriculum
The features on this page are linked to the three aims of the National Curriculum - number fluency, reasoning and problem solving.

Key National Curriculum Content
On this page, you will find features linked to different aspects of the 2014 National Curriculum, including new curriculum content.

Manipulatives
These features focus on how concrete objects can be used as manipulatives in the classroom, and how this can form the basis for problem-solving activities.

Pedagogy
The features listed here come with ideas for embedding the activities into your classroom practice.

Collections

The collections below include our favourite rich tasks, some of which may not appear on the mapping documents, so we suggest you look here too!
Problem-solving Skills
These activities are all based around developing problem-solving skills at KS1 and KS2.

Number
This collection of resources will support understanding of number.

Geometry
This collection of tasks focus on the concepts of shape, position and movement.

Measurement
These resources are based around measuring in a variety of different ways.

Statistics
This collection of activities covers the areas of probability and collecting and analysing data.

Mathematical Habits of Mind

In their paper, Habits of Mind: An Organizing Principle for Mathematics Curricula, researchers Cuoco, Goldenberg and Mark call for mathematics curricula to have ways of thinking about mathematics at their core, rather than specific mathematical results.  With this in mind, we believe that children learn better when they are curious, resourceful, resilient and collaborative.

Here are some collections of mathematical activities designed to give Stage 1 and 2 learners opportunities to develop these desirable characteristics.
Being Curious - Primary
These problems will exploit primary learners' natural curiosity and provoke them to ask good mathematical questions.

Being Resourceful - Primary
These problems require careful consideration. Allow your learners time to become absorbed in them.

Being Collaborative - Primary
These problems are ideal for primary school children to work on with others. Encourage your learners to share ideas, and recognise that two heads can be better than one.

Being Resilient - Primary
These problems require resilience for primary school children. Encourage your learners to persevere - there's often a great sense of achievement when we've had to struggle.

Reading Suggestions
Until you have taken the exams, we recommend that you focus on STEP preparation before all else. In the summer before your course, the following books are recommended.

M R Spiegel, Vector Analysis and an Introduction to Tensor Analysis, Schaum – Chapters 1 to 4 are essential (except for the parts marked as “hard”) but read as much as you can.

R P Feyman, Lectures in Physics – Volume 1 Addison-Wesley, Chapters 1 – 17 and 21 – 25. This is an excellent introduction to the physics side in mathematics. It is especially important if you have not studied physics at school. (Volume II chapters 1 – 8, 12 – 18 and 20 are also interesting and useful).

M Spivak, Calculus, Benjaminc – A good introduction which is aimed slightly above A level and concentrates on techniques.

R P Burn: Numbers and Functionsc, Cambridge University Press – An alternative which concentrates on ideas.

D Smart, Linear Algebra and Geometryc, Cambridge University Press – Provides a good introduction to the algebra and geometry course as well as later material.

T W Körner, The Pleasures of Counting, Cambridge University Press – This gives an excellent but relaxed approach to rigorous mathematics.
