Recommended Reading

Finding out about biochemistry:

The following are popular science books and give a good place to start for anyone who wants to find out something about biochemistry, or just wants some fun background reading.

“The selfish gene”, “The ancestors' tale” and other books by Richard Dawkins.
“Y, the descent of man” by Steve Jones.
“The eighth day of creation: the makers of the revolution in biology” by Horace Judson.
“Power, sex and suicide - mitochondria and the meaning of life” and other books by Nick Lane.
“Advice to a young scientist” by Peter Medawar.
“Genome - autobiography of a species”, “Nature via Nurture” and other books by Matt Ridley.
“The seven daughters of Eve” by Bryan Sykes.

There is a series of booklets on different aspects of biochemistry “Understanding Biochemistry” available for download free from the Biochemical Society  (link below).

There are also web resources available at the Association for Science Education (ASE) web site (link below).

From school to university biochemistry - transitional textbooks:
These provide a gentle introduction to studying biochemistry at a university level.

“Life, chemistry and molecular biology”, W. Pickering, C. Smith and E.J. Wood, pub. Portland Press.
“Why chemical reactions happen”, J. Keeler and P. Wothers, pub. OUP.
“Bringing chemistry to life: from matter to man”, R.J.P. Williams and J.J.R.F. da Silva, pub. Oxford University Press.
“Catch Up Maths & Stats for the life and medical sciences”, M. Harris, G. Taylor and J. Taylor, pub. Scion.
“Catch Up Chemistry for the life and medical sciences”, M. Fry and E. Page, pub. Scion.

Useful books to prepare for the start of the Oxford biochemistry course:
These are very highly recommended for students who are daunted by the maths and organic chemistry components of the course to look at in advance, but would be useful for everyone.

“Foundation maths” (2020) A. Croft and R. Davison, pub. Pearson.
“Foundations of organic chemistry” (1993) M. Hornby and J. Peach, pub. Oxford University Press.

First year text books for the Oxford biochemistry course:

There are no set course texts (and you will probably want to try books out from libraries before deciding what, if anything, to buy) but the following are some of the more popular recommended texts.

“Biochemistry” (2015) J.M. Berg, J.L. Tymoczko and L. Stryer, pub. W.H. Freeman.
“Biochemistry” (2011) D. Voet and J.G. Voet, pub. Wiley.

BIOMEDICAL
SCIENCES
Students often ask for reading suggestions, in order to get their minds tuned into some of the
topics that will be covered, or to simply provide a more general foundation for University. This list of
suggested reading is not an exhaustive one, nor is it a list of material you must read. There are
countless good general texts, so do explore: as well as books, read the local and national press,
browse for relevant podcasts, websites, lectures, events and museums and exhibitions in your
local area. This is not a list of books you should rush out and buy:
 First and foremost, read what interests you the most. Each student should, from early on,
begin to develop their own particular area of expertise.
 Second, consider what subjects or topics relevant to biomedical sciences you may not
cover in your A-level studies (or equivalent).

### 牛津 new school Chemistry pre-reading

If you would like to start reading about some of the chemistry that is relevant to the 1
st year
course, then we would recommend that you have a look at the following review article:
Essays in Biochemistry (2017) 61, 401-427 –

“Essential chemistry for biochemists”

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5869253/pdf/ebc-61-ebc20160094.pdf

### 牛津 new school bio

I run a “book club” tutorial at the start of Hilary term (January) on “The
Ancestor’s Tale” by Richard Dawkins, a kind of back-to-front crash course in
the history of life on earth.

Probably one the most heavily used text book across all three years of the
course is the fourth edition of “An introduction to behavioural ecology” by
Davies, Krebs and West. It covers those parts of biology that the A-Level
syllabus doesn’t seem to reach and is very popular with the students.

https://www.new.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2022-09/Biology_Welcome%20notices%202022_0.pdf

Books

OUP produce a series called Very Short Introductions. Many of these are very good, but the
level of detail varies. Of particular use for our course are:
The Animal Kingdom (Peter Holland)
Plants (Timothy Walker)
Sexual Selection (Marlene Zuk & Leigh Simmons)
Ecology (Jaboury Ghazoul)
Molecular Biology (Aysha Divan & Janice Royds)
The History of Life (Michael Benton)

Theme 1: Building a phenotype
The Epigenetics Revolution and/or Junk DNA (Nessa Carey)
The Gene: an intimate history (Siddharta Mukherjee)
The Immortal life of Henrietta Lacks (Rebecca Skloot)
The Emperor of all maladies (Siddharta Mukherjee)
What is Life? (Paul Nurse)
Transformer - the deep chemistry of life and death (Nick Lane)

Theme 2: The Diversity of Life
I Contain Multitudes (Ed Yong)
Endless Forms most Beautiful (Sean Carroll)
How to Clone a Mammoth (Beth Shapiro)
Bugs in the System (May Berenbaum)

Theme 3: Ecology & Evolution
The Ancestor’s Tale (Richard Dawkins)
Why Evolution is True (J Coyne)
Guns, Germs & Steel (Jared Diamond)
Wilding (Isabella Tree)

Maths
Students should be familiar with the following basic mathematical concepts that are covered
in A-level mathematics:
Partial fractions
Logs and exponentials
Simple differentiations -- linear functions, powers, sums
Simple statistics -- mean, median, mode; standard deviation, variance, inter-quartile range;
basic probability, adding and multiplying probabilites, Binomial distribution, Normal
distribution (including standardising)
In addition, students will be expected to be able to perform simple algebraic manipulations
including manipulating algebraic fractions, such as those required at GCSE. Students who
have not taken A-level would be wise to revise these manipulations.
All the material can be found in two textbooks by Bostock and Chandler. First, everything
except the statistics:
The text is Bostock and Chandler "Mathematics -- The Core Course for A-level". There are
various editions, starting in 1978. Then under the title "Core Maths Advanced Level", starting
in 1994, and continuing until 2013. These are available on Amazon. The newest edition is
about £50 new, which is a lot. However, there are many available second hand for under £5
or under £10. The price difference reflects a key requirement of A-level textbooks, which is
not important for us -- namely, being completely up to date with the prevailing A-level
syllabus. Older editions are thus perfectly fine for our purposes, and indeed probably
preferable because they proceed more expeditiously and cover more material. The relevant
chapters of some of the different editions are as follows:
The 1981 edition:
Revision of basic algebraic manipulations, including fractions: Chapter 1
Partial Fractions - Chapter 1
Logs and exponentials - Chapters 2 and 3
Simple differentiations -- linear functions, powers, sums - Chapter 5
1994 and 2013 editions are more expansive (obviously, read the needed chapters in
numerical order):
Revision of basic algebraic manipulations, including fractions: Chapter 1
Partial Fractions - Chapter 30
Logs and exponentials - Chapters 2 and 17
Simple differentiations -- linear functions, powers, sums - Chapter 13

Now for the statistics. The text is Bostock and Chandler "Modular Mathematics -- Statistics 1
Module C", from 1995. There are many cheap copies floating around. The contents of the
*whole book* are "Representing data; central tendency; dispersion; basic probability;
probability laws; probability distributions and models for discrete variables; discrete uniform,
binomial and Poisson probability models; probability models for continuous variables; the
normal distribution; functions and combinations of random variables." Most of this is
included in the requirements.
However: do note that the Biology course will require *familiarity* with the concepts
mentioned above. Thus, you do not need to work through pages of exercises, but of course
one or two on each topic will greatly assist learning.

Chemistry
All students will need to know the following basic chemistry concepts that are covered in Alevel chemistry:
Atoms, atomic structure, electron orbitals
Bonding (ionic, polar, covalent)
Chemical formulae and molecular diagrams
Redox chemistry
Acids and bases
The concept of moles and molarity

Start by watching the video tutorials that can be found at:
1. https://sciencemusicvideos.com/basic-chemistry-tutorials/
2. https://sciencemusicvideos.com/ap-biology/carbon-and-functional-groups/

Then use Seneca Learning's 'Foundations in Chemistry' course for to revise the key concepts
and to test your knowledge
https://app.senecalearning.com/classroom/course/d40348f4-579a-4f76-b2a8-
12c562e9b836/section/b7c08d8e-7d74-4d9d-8949-95a5cbde6819/session

This will provide all the chemistry knowledge you need to prepare yourself for the first year
of the Biology degree course. But if you want to go into more detail, the following textbook
is a good reference:

Physics

We do not recommend any particular books, although you are encouraged to read widely on subjects that interest you. You may find the Richard Feynman lectures available at  http://research.microsoft.com/apps/tools/tuva/index.html interesting. The most important thing you can do by way of preparation for the Part IA Physics course is to revise your A-level (or equivalent) courses in physics and mathematics, and to work through the mathematics worksheet that you have been sent by your college.  If you would like to try some problems before arriving, you may find the Isaac Physics website worth looking at, in particular the level 3 to 5 problems; however, this is not an essential requirement.  The web address is https://isaacphysics.org.

In addition to the books and websites suggested above for Mathematics, the following may be of interest in getting a sense of how mathematics and statistics are particularly important in biology:

David Spiegelhalter, The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data, Pelican Books
Ian Stewart, Mathematics of the Life: Unlocking the Secrets of Existence, Profile Books
Edward Beltrami, What is Random? Chance and Order in Mathematics and Life, Copernicus Books
We also recommend you remind yourself of certain topics, depending on whether you intend to study Mathematical Biology A or Mathematical Biology B (see: https://www.biology.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/nst/courses/mb/a-and-b).

If you intend to study Mathematical Biology B, you should review the following topics from A Level Mathematics or equivalent: exponentials, logarithms, differentiation, integration and curve sketching.  If you have studied any probability or statistics it would also make sense to look over your notes (but if not, do not worry as these topics will be taught assuming no prior knowledge).

If you intend to study Mathematical Biology A, you must do the preparatory reading and work through the online course as described at https://www.biology.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/nst/courses/mb/a-and-b.

The GMC and Medical Schools Council booklet "Medical students: professional values and fitness to practice" (available via the links below). On the first day of your course, you will be asked to sign a declaration, the Medical Student Register Agreement, stating that you have read these documents and agree to abide by the conditions set out in them.

Your first few weeks in Cambridge will be easier if you are familiar with the Key Science Concepts (also accessible via the links).

If you did not study Biology, we recommend that you do some preliminary reading to ensure that you know some basic cell biology. The faculty has provided an introduction to Cell Biology and recommended reading list.
